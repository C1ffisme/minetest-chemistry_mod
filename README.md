minetest-chemistry_mod
======================

A chemistry mod for minetest.

Very incomplete, needs more stuff. Maybe radiation or stuff?

Currently we have alchemy, which can sometimes give you more mese and diamond then before. 
TODO : Should we balance it out so that you cant make infinite mese and diamond, or make the process harder.

We also have some uranium, which kills nearby plants, and it can also be used as a mineral detector, but we should probably find a better way to show where the stuff is.

We also have a few medicines, which are probably WAY too powerful. And very unrealistic.
And, we also have plastic, which might be the best feature of the mod.

Depends : Minetest. You can find it here : minetest.net

Some ideas:

- Radiation
- Alchemy Improvement
- Mutation
- Realistic Medicines that only heal in certain conditions
- Nukes? (Nah, that would probably make this mod bad content for no-grief servers, unless you could disable it.)
- Nuclear Power (Why haven't we (as in myself) made this yet? Maybe you can use it to power mesecons or something.)
- More, actual, chemistry. Chemical Reactions, Heat, etc.
